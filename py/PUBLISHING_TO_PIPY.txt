This is tutorial how to publish pySparkling on PyPi

1 - Build sparkling-water. This is necessary step as the build process prepares additional packages which needs to be
in the python package - sparkling_water package containing sparkling-water jar and h2o containing h2o python files

./gradlew build -x check

2 - Ensure you have .pypirc file in the ~ ( home) directory with the following content:

[distutils]
index-servers =
  pypi
  pypitest

[pypi]
repository=https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username=your_username_to_pypi
password=your_password_to_pypi

[pypitest]
repository=https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
username=your_username_to_testpypi
password=your_password_to_testpypi


In the file are actually two servers - pypi and pypitest. Pypi is live server where the package needs to be uploaded
and pypitest is just for testing that our package uploads well on the server and has correct format.

3 - Test that the package successfully registers and uploads to pypi test by running in ./py directory
python setup.py register -r pypitest
python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest

4 - If everything goes well, register and upload the package on pypi live
python setup.py register -r pypi
python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi


5 - Don't forget to do this for each pySparkling release ( for Spark 1.5, Spark 1.6 ... )
    and for each spark release publish it for both scala versions 2.10 and 2.11

6 - That's it!
