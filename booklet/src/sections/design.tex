\section{Design}
Sparkling Water is designed to be executed as a regular Spark application. It provides a way to initialize H2O services on Spark and access data stored in data structures of Spark and H2O.

Sparkling Water supports two type of backends. In the internal backend, Sparkling Water is launched inside
a Spark executor, which is created after application submission. At this point, H2O starts services,
including distributed key-value (K/V) store and memory manager, and orchestrates them into a cloud.
The topology of the created cloud matches the topology of the underlying Spark cluster exactly.
The following figure represents the Internal Sparkling Water cluster.

In external backend, the H2O cluster is started separately and is connected to from the Spark driver. The following figure represents the External Sparkling Water cluster.

More information about backends is available in the next section.

\subsection{Data Sharing between Spark and H2O}

Sparkling Water enables transformation between different types of RDDs and H2O's \texttt{H2OFrame}, and vice versa.

When converting from an \texttt{H2OFrame} to an RDD, a wrapper is created around the \texttt{H2OFrame} to provide an RDD-like API. In this case,  data is not duplicated but served directly from the underlying \texttt{H2OFrame}.

Converting from an RDD/DataFrame to an \texttt{H2OFrame} requires data duplication because it transfers data from the RDD storage into \texttt{H2OFrame}. However, data stored in an \texttt{H2OFrame} is heavily compressed and does not need to be preserved in RDD.

\subsection{Provided Primitives}

Sparkling Water provides several primitives (Table~\ref{tab:primitives}), which are the basic components used by Spark components.

Before using H2O algorithms and data structures, the first step is to create and start the \texttt{H2OContext} instance using the \\
\texttt{val hc = new H2OContext.getOrCreate(spark)} call.
\texttt{H2OContext} contains the necessary information for running H2O services and exposes methods for data transformation between the Spark RDD, \texttt{DataFrame} or \texttt{Dataset}, and the \texttt{H2OFrame}.
Starting \texttt{H2OContext} involves an operation that:

\begin{itemize}
 \item In case of internal backend, is distributed and contacts all accessible Spark executor nodes and initializes H2O services (such as the key-value store and RPC) inside the executors' JVMs.
 \item In case of external backend, either starts H2O cluster on YARN and connects to it or connects to existing H2O cluster right away (depends on the configuration).
\end{itemize}

\newpage
When \texttt{H2OContext} is running, H2O data structures and algorithms can be manipulated. The key data structure is \texttt{H2OFrame}, which represents a distributed table composed of vectors. A new \texttt{H2OFrame} can be created using one of the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
	\item loading a cluster local file (a file located on each node of the cluster):
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Scala]
val h2oFrame = new H2OFrame(new File("/data/iris.csv"))
\end{lstlisting}
	\item loading a file from HDFS/S3/S3N/S3A:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Scala]
val h2oFrame = new H2OFrame(URI.create("hdfs://data/iris.csv"))
\end{lstlisting}
	\item loading multiple files from HDFS/S3/S3N/S3A:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Scala]
val h2oFrame = new H2OFrame(
    URI.create("hdfs://data/iris/01.csv"),
    URI.create("hdfs://data/iris/02.csv")
)
\end{lstlisting}
	\item transforming Spark RDD, \texttt{DataFrame} or \texttt{Dataset}:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Scala]
val h2oFrame = h2oContext.asH2OFrame(sparkData)
\end{lstlisting}
	\item referencing existing \texttt{H2OFrame} by its key
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Scala]
val h2oFrame = new H2OFrame("iris.hex")
\end{lstlisting}		
\end{itemize}


When \texttt{H2OContext} is running, any H2O algorithm can be called. Most of the provided algorithms are located in the \texttt{hex} package. Calling an algorithm is composed of two steps:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Specifying parameters:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Scala]
val train: H2OFrame = new H2OFrame(new File("prostate.csv"))
val gbmParams = new GBMParameters()
gbmParams._train = train
gbmParams._response_column = "CAPSULE"
gbmParams._ntrees = 10
\end{lstlisting}

	\item Creating the model builder and launching computations. The \texttt{trainModel} method is non-blocking and returns a job representing the computation.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Scala]
val gbmModel = new GBM(gbmParams).trainModel.get
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
