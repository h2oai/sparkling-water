Sparkling Water
===============

Sparkling Water integrates `H2O-3 <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/>`__, a fast scalable machine learning engine with `Apache Spark <https://spark.apache.org/>`__. It provides:

- Utilities to publish Spark data structures (RDDs, DataFrames, Datasets) as H2O-3's frames and vice versa.
- DSL to use Spark data structures as input for H2O's algorithms.
- Basic building blocks to create ML applications utilizing Spark and H2O APIs.
- Python interface enabling use of Sparkling Water directly from PySpark.

Getting Started

Try Sparkling Water!
--------------------

Sparkling Water is distributed as a Spark application library which can be used by any Spark application.
Furthermore, we provide also zip distribution which bundles the library and shell scripts.

There are several ways of using Sparkling Water:

- Sparkling Shell (Spark Shell with Sparkling Water included)
- Sparkling Water driver (Spark Submit with Sparkling Water included)
- Spark Shell and include Sparkling Water library via ``--jars`` or ``--packages`` option
- Spark Submit and include Sparkling Water library via ``--jars`` or ``--packages`` option
- PySpark with PySparkling


Run Sparkling shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Sparkling shell encapsulates a regular Spark shell and append Sparkling Water library on the classpath via ``--jars`` option.
The Sparkling Shell supports creation of an H2O-3 cloud and execution of H2O-3 algorithms.

1. Either download or build Sparkling Water
2. Configure the location of Spark cluster:

   .. code:: bash

      export SPARK_HOME="/path/to/spark/installation"
      export MASTER="local[*]"


   In this case, ``local[*]`` points to an embedded single node cluster.

3. Run Sparkling Shell:

   .. code:: bash

      bin/sparkling-shell

   Sparkling Shell accepts common Spark Shell arguments. For example, to increase memory allocated by each executor, use the ``spark.executor.memory`` parameter: ``bin/sparkling-shell --conf "spark.executor.memory=4g"``

4. Initialize H2OContext

   .. code:: scala

      import ai.h2o.sparkling._
      val hc = H2OContext.getOrCreate()

   ``H2OContext`` starts H2O services on top of Spark cluster and provides primitives for transformations between H2O-3 and Spark data structures.


Use Sparkling Water with PySpark
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sparkling Water can be also used directly from PySpark and the integration is called PySparkling.

See `PySparkling README <http://docs.h2o.ai/sparkling-water/3.4/latest-stable/doc/pysparkling.html>`__ to learn about PySparkling.

Use Sparkling Water via Spark Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see how Sparkling Water can be used as Spark package, please see `Use as Spark Package <http://docs.h2o.ai/sparkling-water/3.4/latest-stable/doc/tutorials/use_as_spark_package.html>`__.

Use Sparkling Water in Windows environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See `Windows Tutorial <http://docs.h2o.ai/sparkling-water/3.4/latest-stable/doc/tutorials/run_on_windows.html>`__ to learn how to use Sparkling Water in Windows environments.

Sparkling Water examples

Maven packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Sparkling Water release is published into Maven central with following coordinates:

- ``ai.h2o:sparkling-water-core_{{scala_version}}:{{version}}`` - Includes core of Sparkling Water
- ``ai.h2o:sparkling-water-examples_{{scala_version}}:{{version}}`` - Includes example applications
- ``ai.h2o:sparkling-water-repl_{{scala_version}}:{{version}}`` - Spark REPL integration into H2O Flow UI

- ``ai.h2o:sparkling-water-scoring-package_{{scala_version}}:{{version}}`` - Lightweight Sparkling Water package including all dependencies required just for scoring with H2O-3 and DAI MOJO models.
- ``ai.h2o:sparkling-water-package_{{scala_version}}:{{version}}`` - Sparkling Water package containing all dependencies required for model training and scoring. This is designed to use as Spark package via ``--packages`` option.

   **Note:** The ``{{version}}`` references to a release version of Sparkling Water, the ``{{scala_version}}``
   references to Scala base version.

Sparkling water supports two backend/deployment modes - internal and
external. Sparkling Water applications are independent on the selected
backend. The backend can be specified before creation of the
``H2OContext``.

For more details regarding the internal or external backend, please see
