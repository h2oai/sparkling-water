Running Sparkling Water Examples
--------------------------------

The Sparkling Water distribution includes also a set of examples. You can find their implementation in `examples directory <https://github.com/h2oai/sparkling-water/tree/master/examples>`__. You can build and run them in the following way:

1. Build a package that can be submitted to Spark cluster:

   .. code:: bash

        ./gradlew build -x check

2. Set the configuration of the demo Spark cluster (for example, ``local[*]``)

   .. code:: bash

        export SPARK_HOME="/path/to/spark/installation"
        export MASTER="local[*]"

   In this example, the description ``local[*]`` causes creation of a single node local cluster.


3. And run the example:

 - On Local Cluster:

    The local cluster is defined by ``MASTER`` address ``local``, ``local[*]`` or additional variants
    available at `Spark Master URLs <https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html#master-urls>`__.

    .. code:: bash

        bin/run-example.sh <name of example>

 - On a Spark Standalone Cluster:

    - Run the Spark cluster, for example via:

        .. code:: bash

            bin/launch-spark-cloud.sh


    - Verify that Spark is running: The Spark UI on http://localhost:8080/ should show 3 worker nodes
    - Export ``MASTER`` address of Spark master using:

        .. code:: bash

            export MASTER="spark://localhost:7077"


    - Run example:

        .. code:: bash

            bin/run-example.sh <name of example>


    - Observe the status of the application via Spark UI on http://localhost:8080/
