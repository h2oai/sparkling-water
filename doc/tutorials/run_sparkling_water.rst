Running Sparkling Water
-----------------------

In order to run Sparkling Water, the environment must contain the property ``SPARK_HOME`` that points to the Spark distribution.

H2O on Spark can be started in the Spark Shell or in the Spark application as:

.. code:: bash

    ./bin/sparkling-shell

Sparkling Water (H2O on Spark) can be initiated using the following call:

.. code:: scala

    val hc = H2OContext.getOrCreate(spark)

The semantic of the call depends on the configured Sparkling Water backend. For more information about the backends, please see :ref:`backend`.

In internal backend mode, the call will:

1. Collect the number and host names of the executors (worker nodes) in the Spark cluster
2. Launch H2O services on each detected executor
3. Create a cloud for H2O services based on the list of executors
4. Verify the H2O cloud status

In external backend mode, the call will:

1. Start H2O in client mode on the Spark driver
2. Start the separated H2O cluster on the configured YARN queue
3. Connect to the external cluster from the H2O client
