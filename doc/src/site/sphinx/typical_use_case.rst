Typical Use Case
----------------

Sparkling Water excels in leveraging existing Spark-based workflows that need to call advanced machine learning algorithms. A typical example involves data munging with the help of a Spark API, where a prepared table is passed to the H2O DeepLearning algorithm. The constructed DeepLearning model estimates different metrics based on the testing data, which can be used in the rest of the Spark workflow.
