About Sparkling Water
=====================

Sparkling Water allows users to combine the fast, scalable machine learning algorithms of H2O with the capabilities of Spark. With Sparkling Water, users can drive computation from Scala/R/Python and utilize the H2O Flow UI, providing an ideal machine learning platform for application developers.

Spark is an elegant and powerful general-purpose, open-source, in-memory platform with tremendous momentum. H2O is an in-memory application for machine learning that is reshaping how people apply math and predictive analytics to their business problems.

Integrating these two open-source environments provides a seamless experience for users who want to make a query  using Spark SQL, feed the results into H2O to build a model and make predictions, and then use the results again in
Spark. For any given problem, better interoperability between tools provides a better experience.
