Target Encoding in Sparkling Water
==================================
Target Encoding in Sparkling Water is a mechanism of converting categorical features to continues features based on
the mean calculated from values of the label (target) column.

An example of converting a categorical feature to continues with Target Encoder (`Town_te` is a produced column):

 =============== ======= =========
  Town            Label   Town_te  
 =============== ======= ========= 
  Chennai         1       0.8      
  Prague          0       0.286    
  Chennai         0       0.8      
  Mountain View   1       0.714    
  Chennai         1       0.8      
  Prague          1       0.286    
  Mountain View   1       0.714    
  Chennai         1       0.8

Target Encoding can help to improve accuracy of machine learning algorithms when columns with high
cardinality are used as features during training phase.

Parameters
----------
labelCol
    A name of label column

inputCols
    Names of columns that will be transformed to Target Encoding

outputCols
    Names of columns representing the result of target encoding. If the parameter is not specified by user, the output
    column names will be automatically derived from ``inputCols`` by appending the suffix `_te`.

holdoutStrategy
    A strategy deciding what records will be excluded when calculating the target average on the training dataset.

    Options:

      None
        All rows are considered for the calculation

      LeaveOneOut
        All rows except the row the calculation is made for

      KFold
        Only out-of-fold data is considered (The option requires ``foldCol`` to be set.)

foldCol
    A name of a column determining folds when ``KFold`` holdoutStrategy is applied.

blendedAvgEnabled
    If set, the target average becomes a weighted average of the posterior average for a given categorical level
    and the prior average of the target. The weight is determined by the size of the given group that the row belongs to.
    By default, the blended average is **disabled**.

blendedAvgInflectionPoint
    A parameter of the blended average. The bigger number is set, the groups relatively bigger to the overall dataset size
    will consider the prior average as a component in the weighted average. The default value is **10**.

blendedAvgSmoothing
    A parameter of the blended average. It controls the rate of a transition between a posterior average and a prior average.
    The default value is **20**.

noise
    Amount of random noise added to output values of a training dataset to prevent over-fitting of an algorithm consuming
    encoded features. The default value is **0.01**. Noise addition can be disabled by setting the parameter to **0.0**.

noiseSeed
    A seed of the generator producing the random noise.

Using Target Encoder
--------------------
Sparkling Water exposes API for target encoder in Scala and Python. Before we start using Target Encoder, we need to run
and prepare the environment:

.. content-tabs::

    .. tab-container:: Scala
        :title: Scala

        First, let's start Sparkling Shell (use *:paste* mode when you try to copy-paste examples):

        .. code:: shell

            ./bin/sparkling-shell

        Start H2O cluster inside the Spark environment:

        .. code:: scala

            import org.apache.spark.h2o._
            import java.net.URI
            val hc = H2OContext.getOrCreate()

        Parse the data using H2O and convert them to Spark Frame:

        .. code:: scala

            val frame = new H2OFrame(new URI("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h2oai/sparkling-water/master/examples/smalldata/prostate/prostate.csv"))
            val sparkDF = hc.asDataFrame(frame).withColumn("CAPSULE", $"CAPSULE" cast "string")
            val Array(trainingDF, testingDF) = sparkDF.randomSplit(Array(0.8, 0.2))

    .. tab-container:: Python
        :title: Python

        First, let's start PySparkling Shell:

        .. code:: shell

            ./bin/pysparkling

        Start H2O cluster inside the Spark environment:

        .. code:: python

            from pysparkling import *
            hc = H2OContext.getOrCreate()

        Parse the data using H2O and convert them to Spark Frame:

        .. code:: python

            import h2o
            frame = h2o.import_file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h2oai/sparkling-water/master/examples/smalldata/prostate/prostate.csv")
            sparkDF = hc.asSparkFrame(frame)
            sparkDF = sparkDF.withColumn("CAPSULE", sparkDF.CAPSULE.cast("string"))
            [trainingDF, testingDF] = sparkDF.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2])


Target Encoder in ML Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Target Encoder in Sparkling Water is implemented as a regular estimator and thus could be placed as a stage to Spark ML Pipeline

.. content-tabs::

    .. tab-container:: Scala
        :title: Scala

        Let's create an instance of Target Encoder and configure it:

        .. code:: scala

            import ai.h2o.sparkling.ml.features.H2OTargetEncoder
            val targetEncoder = new H2OTargetEncoder()
              .setInputCols(Array("RACE", "DPROS", "DCAPS"))
              .setLabelCol("CAPSULE")

        Also create an instance of an algorithm consuming encoded columns and define pipeline:

        .. code:: scala

            import ai.h2o.sparkling.ml.algos.H2OGBM
            import org.apache.spark.ml.Pipeline
            val gbm = new H2OGBM()
                .setFeaturesCols(targetEncoder.getOutputCols())
                .setLabelCol("CAPSULE")
            val pipeline = new Pipeline().setStages(Array(targetEncoder, gbm))

        Train the created pipeline

        .. code:: scala

            val pipelineModel = pipeline.fit(trainingDF)

        Make predictions including a model of Target Encoder:

        .. code:: scala

            pipelineModel.transform(testingDF).show()

        The model of Target Encoder is persistable to MOJO, so you can save and load the whole pipeline model:

        .. code:: scala

            import org.apache.spark.ml.PipelineModel
            pipelineModel.write.save("somePathForStoringPipelineModel")
            val loadedPipelineModel = PipelineModel.load("somePathForStoringPipelineModel")
            loadedPipelineModel.transform(testingDF).show()

    .. tab-container:: Python
        :title: Python

        Let's create an instance of Target Encoder and configure it:

        .. code:: python

            from pysparkling.ml import H2OTargetEncoder
            targetEncoder = H2OTargetEncoder()\
              .setInputCols(["RACE", "DPROS", "DCAPS"])\
              .setLabelCol("CAPSULE")

        Also create an instance of an algorithm consuming encoded columns and define pipeline:

        .. code:: python

            from pysparkling.ml import H2OGBM
            from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
            gbm = H2OGBM()\
                .setFeaturesCols(targetEncoder.getOutputCols())\
                .setLabelCol("CAPSULE")
            pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[targetEncoder, gbm])

        Train the created pipeline

        .. code:: python

            pipelineModel = pipeline.fit(trainingDF)

        Make predictions including a model of Target Encoder:

        .. code:: python

            pipelineModel.transform(testingDF).show()

        The model of Target Encoder is persistable to MOJO, so you can save and load the whole pipeline model:

        .. code:: python

            from pyspark.ml import PipelineModel
            pipelineModel.save("somePathForStoringPipelineModel")
            loadedPipelineModel = PipelineModel.load("somePathForStoringPipelineModel")
            loadedPipelineModel.transform(testingDF).show()


Standalone Target Encoder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Target Encoder's parameters like ``noise`` and ``holdoutStrategy`` are relevant only for a training dataset.
Thus the ``transform`` method of ``H2OTargetEncoderModel`` has to treat training and other data sets differently and
eventually ignore the mentioned parameters.

When Target Encoder is inside ML pipeline, the differentiation is done automatically. But if a user decides to train
an algorithm without ML pipeline, the 'transformTrainingDataset' method should be on the model of Target Encoder to get
appropriate results.


Limitations and Edge Cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The label column can't contain more than two unique categorical values.
- The label column can't contain any ``null`` values.
- Input columns transformed by Target Encoder can contain ``null`` values.
- Novel values in a testing/production data set and ``null`` values belong to the same category. In other words,
  Target Encoder returns a prior average for all novel values in case a given column of the training dataset
  did not contain any ``null`` values. Otherwise, the posterior average of rows having ``null`` values in the column is returned.
