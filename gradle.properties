# Water against Spark built with scala 2.10, then this property can be overriden by -P option.

# You can specify full scala version here, such as 2.10.6 and in that case, Sparkling Water will be built with
# this exact version, or you can just set 2.10 and in that case Sparkling Water will be built with default scala
# version - in case of 2.10 it is 2.10.6 and in case of 2.11 it is 2.11.7
