Sparkling Water integrates H<sub>2</sub>O's fast scalable machine learning engine with Spark. It provides: 
 - Utilities to publish Spark data structures (RDDs, DataFrames) as H2O's frames and vice versa. 
 - DSL to use Spark data structures as input for H2O's algorithms
 - Basic building blocks to create ML applications utilizing Spark and H2O APIs
 - Python interface enabling use of Sparkling Water directly from pySpark

## Getting Started

### Select right version
The Sparkling Water is developed in multiple parallel branches.
Each branch corresponds to a Spark major release (e.g., branch **rel-1.5** provides implementation of Sparkling Water for Spark **1.5**).

Please, switch to the right branch:
 - For Spark 1.6 use branch [rel-1.6](https://github.com/h2oai/sparkling-water/tree/rel-1.6)
 - For Spark 1.5 use branch [rel-1.5](https://github.com/h2oai/sparkling-water/tree/rel-1.5)
 - For Spark 1.4 use branch [rel-1.4](https://github.com/h2oai/sparkling-water/tree/rel-1.4)
 - For Spark 1.3 use branch [rel-1.3](https://github.com/h2oai/sparkling-water/tree/rel-1.3)

> Note: The [master](https://github.com/h2oai/sparkling-water/tree/master) branch includes the latest changes
for the latest Spark version. They are back-ported into older Sparkling Water versions.

<a name="Req"></a>
### Requirements

  * Linux/OS X/Windows
  * Java 7+
  * [Spark 1.3+](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)
    * `SPARK_HOME` shell variable must point to your local Spark installation

---
<a name="MakeBuild"></a>
### Build

Download Spark installation and point environment variable `SPARK_HOME` to it.
Then use the provided `gradlew` to build project:

In order to build the whole project, one of the following properties needs to be set: 
`H2O_HOME`, which should point to location of local h2o project directory, or `H2O_PYTHON_WHEEL`, which should point to H2O Python Wheel.

If you are not sure which property to set, just run
```
./gradlew build
```
and the commands which sets the `H2O_PYTHON_WHEEL` will be shown on your console and can be copy-pasted into your terminal. After setting the property, the build needs to be rerun.

> To avoid running tests, use the `-x test -x integTest` option.

## Use Sparkling Water

Sparkling Water is distributed as a Spark application library which can be used by any Spark application. 
Furthermore, we provide also zip distribution which bundles the library and shell scripts.

There are several ways of using Sparkling Water:
  - Sparkling Shell
  - Sparkling Water driver
  - Spark Shell and include Sparkling Water library via `--jars` or `--packages` option
  - Spark Submit and include Sparkling Water library via `--jars` or `--packages` option
  - pySpark with pySparkling

---

H2O cloud is created automatically during the call of `H2OContext.getOrCreate`. Since it's not
technically possible to get number of executors in Spark, we try to discover all executors at the initiation of `H2OContext`
and we start H2O instance inside of each discovered executor. This solution is easiest to deploy; however when Spark
or YARN kills the executor - which is not an unusual case - the whole H2O cluster goes down since h2o doesn't support high 
availability. 


Here we show a few examples how H2OContext can be started.

Explicitly specify internal backend on `H2OConf`
```
val conf = new H2OConf(sc).setInternalClusterMode()
val h2oContext = H2OContext.getOrCreate(sc, conf)
```

If `spark.ext.h2o.backend.cluster.mode` property was set to `internal` either on command line or on the `SparkConf` class
 we can call:
```
val h2oContext = H2OContext.getOrCreate(sc) 
```

or

```
val conf = new H2OConf(sc)
val h2oContext = H2OContext.getOrCreate(sc, conf)
```



<a name="SparkShell"></a>
### Run Sparkling shell

The Sparkling shell encapsulates a regular Spark shell and append Sparkling Water library on the classpath via `--jars` option. 
The Sparkling Shell supports creation of an H<sub>2</sub>O cloud and execution of H<sub>2</sub>O algorithms.

1. First, build a package containing Sparkling water:
  ```
  ./gradlew assemble
  ```

2. Configure the location of Spark cluster:
  ```
  export SPARK_HOME="/path/to/spark/installation"
  export MASTER="local-cluster[3,2,2048]"
  ```

  > In this case, `local-cluster[3,2,2048]` points to embedded cluster of 3 worker nodes, each with 2 cores and 2G of memory.

3. Run Sparkling Shell:
  ```
  bin/sparkling-shell
  ```

  > Sparkling Shell accepts common Spark Shell arguments. For example, to increase memory allocated by each executor, use the `spark.executor.memory` parameter: `bin/sparkling-shell --conf "spark.executor.memory=4g"`

4. Initialize H2OContext 
  ```scala
  import org.apache.spark.h2o._
  val hc = H2OContext.getOrCreate(sc)
  ```

  > H2OContext start H2O services on top of Spark cluster and provides primitives for transformations between H2O and Spark datastructures.

### Run examples
The Sparkling Water distribution includes also a set of examples. You can find there implementation in [example folder](example/). 
You can run them in the following way:

1. Build a package that can be submitted to Spark cluster:
  ```
  ./gradlew assemble
  ```

2. Set the configuration of the demo Spark cluster (for example, `local-cluster[3,2,1024]`)
  ```
  export SPARK_HOME="/path/to/spark/installation"
  export MASTER="local-cluster[3,2,1024]"
  ```
  > In this example, the description `local-cluster[3,2,1024]` causes creation of a local cluster consisting of 3 workers.

3. And run the example:
  ```
  bin/run-example.sh
  ```

For more details about examples, please see the [README.md](examples/README.md) file in the [examples directory](examples/).

<a name="PySparkling"></a>
### Run PySparkling
Sparkling Water can be also used directly from PySpark.
 
See [py/README.md](py/README.rst) to learn about PySparkling.

---
<a name="Packages"></a>
### Use Sparkling Water via Spark Packages
Sparkling Water is also published as a Spark package. 
You can use it directly from your Spark distribution.

For example, if you have Spark version 1.5 and would like to use Sparkling Water version 1.5.2 and launch example `CraigslistJobTitlesStreamingApp`, then you can use the following command:

```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --packages ai.h2o:sparkling-water-core_2.10:1.5.2,ai.h2o:sparkling-water-examples_2.10:1.5.2 --class org.apache.spark.examples.h2o.CraigslistJobTitlesStreamingApp /dev/null
```
The Spark option `--packages` points to published Sparkling Water packages in Maven repository.


The similar command works for `spark-shell`:
```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell --packages ai.h2o:sparkling-water-core_2.10:1.5.2,ai.h2o:sparkling-water-examples_2.10:1.5.2 
```


The same command works for Python programs:
```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --packages ai.h2o:sparkling-water-core_2.10:1.5.2,ai.h2o:sparkling-water-examples_2.10:1.5.2 example.py
```

> Note: When you are using Spark packages you do not need to download Sparkling Water distribution! Spark installation is sufficient!

## FAQ

* Where do I find the Spark logs?
  
 > **Standalone mode**: Spark executor logs are located in the directory `$SPARK_HOME/work/app-<AppName>` (where `<AppName>` is the name of your application). The location contains also stdout/stderr from H2O.
 
 > **YARN mode**: The executors logs are available via `yarn logs -applicationId <appId>` command. Driver logs are by default printed to console, however, H2O also writes logs into `current_dir/h2ologs`.
 
 > The location of H2O driver logs can be controlled via Spark property `spark.ext.h2o.client.log.dir` (pass via `--conf`) option.
 
* Spark is very slow during initialization or H2O does not form a cluster. What should I do?
  
 > Configure the Spark variable `SPARK_LOCAL_IP`. For example: 
  ```
  export SPARK_LOCAL_IP='127.0.0.1'
  ```  

* How do I increase the amount of memory assigned to the Spark executors in Sparkling Shell?
 
 > Sparkling Shell accepts common Spark Shell arguments. For example, to increase
 > the amount of memory allocated by each executor, use the `spark.executor.memory`
 > parameter: `bin/sparkling-shell --conf "spark.executor.memory=4g"`

* How do I change the base port H2O uses to find available ports?
  
  > The H2O accepts `spark.ext.h2o.port.base` parameter via Spark configuration properties: `bin/sparkling-shell --conf "spark.ext.h2o.port.base=13431"`. For a complete list of configuration options, refer to [Devel Documentation](https://github.com/h2oai/sparkling-water/blob/master/DEVEL.md#sparkling-water-configuration-properties).

* How do I use Sparkling Shell to launch a Scala `test.script` that I created?

 > Sparkling Shell accepts common Spark Shell arguments. To pass your script, please use `-i` option of Spark Shell:
 > `bin/sparkling-shell -i test.script`

* How do I increase PermGen size for Spark driver?

 > Specify `--conf spark.driver.extraJavaOptions="-XX:MaxPermSize=384m"`
 
* How do I add Apache Spark classes to Python path?
 
 > Configure the Python path variable `PYTHONPATH`:
  ```
  export PYTHONPATH=$SPARK_HOME/python:$SPARK_HOME/python/build:$PYTHONPATH
  export PYTHONPATH=$SPARK_HOME/python/lib/py4j-0.9-src.zip:$PYTHONPATH
  ```

* Trying to import a class from the `hex` package in Sparkling Shell but getting weird error:
  ```
  error: missing arguments for method hex in object functions;
  follow this method with '_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied
  ```

  > In this case you are probably using Spark 1.5 which is importing SQL functions
    into Spark Shell environment. Please use the following syntax to import a class 	from the `hex` package:
    ```
    import _root_.hex.tree.gbm.GBM
    ```
